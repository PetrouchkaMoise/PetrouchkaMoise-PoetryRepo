Danni: f*ckboys. 
They come in all shapes and sizes and results may vary 
but when he a f*ckboy…and u will know..  
He thinks about himself and only himself. 
A manipulating d*ck who does whatever it takes to benefit him,
regardless of who he screws over. 



Kaiya: I will always love you\

Bri: and the polygraph determined…That was a lie . 
There is a fine line between love and hate 
and
I walked that line with you.
Paswsionate Kisses,
To Spiteful Ignorance.
Tender Hugs,
To Evil Glares.
Sweet Laughter,
To Painful Silence.
Eternal Love,
To Everlasting Hate.
How I wish we could travel back to the cupcake phase 

Kaiya: I knew you were trouble when you walked in so shame on me now, flew me to places I've never been till you put me down 

Bri: 
you are categorized as one of those boys 
the ones my mother warned me about 
you know the boys that only want the milk and not the cow  
the ones girls love to hate and hate to love
you come in with your dreamy brown eyes and tell me 
nothing but lies 
i ain't like those other guys
LIE 
i ain't gon make you cry 
LIE
i care about yo feelings 
LIE
you were important to me but that not all
It was only a matter a time before you 
hit me with 
“THE QUESTION”
No I do not send pic 
NO I would not like to see you dick

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more)
no i dont need you (anymore ) don't wanna see you(no more)
If you disappear
I will never ask where you went. 
Your absence will not cause me pain,
Only pleasure. 
I promised that this would be the last time,
And i never break promises.

Kaiya:How come I always fall for your type..
 
I just can’t explain this ish at all.
I thought that we could be more than friends.
You played with my heart strings.
Moon walked all over my emotions.

You were a penny, giving basics your head
and me, your tail.
You remind me of a fake bag in a Gucci store
surround by G;s but you’re not one
I happily gave you a place 
thinking that you would change
I see now that you are the epitome of an a**hole.
I thought you were a G.I. Joe
but it turns out you were just
a regular Joe on IG.

You taught me how to hate.
Sometimes I feel so silly for ever caring about you

Now I’m moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other girls.
I'm not good enough for you
I thought that we was cool.
Forgive and forget, dude I already forgot.
I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not four-ever.
You misused me since i was nice.
I’ll give you a choice in the elevator.
you can have the Solange or the Ray Rice.
I’m done.
