Dear Hansel,
I know you believed our parents 
had good intentions. 
Two too many mouths to feed was excuse enough
to venture into the woods.
And with what?!
How was a slice of bread suppose to help us.

Dear Hansel,
You remember father when he still filled his figure.
It's hard out here for a pimp but,
his game was week from jump.
Mom lived off of broken promises
and swallowed our poverty with disdain.
So in a way this separation was our golden ticket.

Dear Hansel, 
everything that glitters,
Aint. Food. 
We let hunger eat up our right mind
and devoured temptation right into the holding cell.
I wonder that if our friends could’ve seen us then maybe, 
there would have been an amber alert,
or a hashtag in our honor.

Dear #Hansel,
You’ve become a hashtag.

Dear #Hansel,
She fed you every three hours.
I warned you to suppress your dying to stuff your face.
to even set aside your plate.
I know it was hard.
I can't help but to think I failed you, 
I should have bones from a rotting carcass
into your chamber of sweetness.
So that when she came to measure 
Your enticing plumpness 
you could fool her and gain an extra day.
Another moment together. 
Instead, I screamed bloody murder 
from the inside of locked lungs
and damaged windpipes,
and an unspoken voice box.

Dear #Hansel,
You didn’t live past Sunday.

Dear #Hansel,
I hope the Based God welcomed you.
Opened the Pearly	White	Gates
Laid out a feast to replace the meals 
our parents couldn’t provide.
Engulf you in the finest silk robes. 


Dear #Hansel, 
	Save me a seat.
